# Python Modules Demo

This project is a simple Python application that showcases the use of custom modules for basic greeting and wishing operations. It consists of a main script (`main.py`) that imports and utilizes two utility modules:

- `GreetModule`: Contains a `Greet` class for generating personalized hello messages.
- `WishModule`: Contains a `Wish` class for creating wish statements.

## Usage

Run the main script to see the modules in action:

```bash
python [main.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)


### To RUN 
* py main.py 

```
